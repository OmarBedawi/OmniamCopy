                    </div>
                        <h5>
                            Every true self-proclaimed Cannabis <b class="bold_text">connoisseur</b> had dreamed about a time when 
                            he could enter a high-end store and order perhaps a single nugget of <b class="bold_text">original</b> 
                            White Widow, or a Temple Ball coming straight out of the hands of a renowned <b class="bold_text">hashishin</b> 
                            like Frenchy Cannoli (R.I.P.), or the odd looking Dr. Grinspoon, and after a suspense loaded wait, could 
                            enjoy what purchased, whether on the spot in an adjacent lounge room or - another bliss of life - pack 
                            it as a <b class="bold_text">gift</b> for a dear friend.    
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Exactly like how it would happen entering the doorstep of a distinguished winery, where the classy 
                            liquor is esteemed, we thrive to feel the same reverence and professionality towards our precious 
                            greenery in a famous Amsterdam-based coffee shop.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            However, it is still not quite the same.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            What differentiates the two plants? Simple, perception.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            So what can be done to alter the perception of detractors as well as the majority of the users themselves?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            If I'm wrong, answer this: who would face perplexities - in the workplace or in the family - you drinking 
                            a glass of wine or you tasting a joint?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            By that I mean exactly what it is; exception made for the <b class="bold_text">real</b> connoisseurs, 
                            the general folks look at the consuming of the plant strictly as a channel to achieve a goal, the “high”, 
                            and the stigma that it carries.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            That is what should and will happen with our precious ganja too, the field needs to set common boundaries 
                            and declare the limits of our “race”, we cannot compete both in sprint and marathon.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            You have the taste contest (same field of the wine) and you have the potency contest (whatever liquor 
                            has the highest gradation).
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Did you know that the perfect wine gradation is 13,6%?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Have you ever heard of perfect THC potency?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Let’s fix that!
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            There is much work to be done, the ball is starting to roll in our favor, there is culture to be spread, 
                            minds to educate, tongues to develop, a unified scientific method to discuss, and so on and so forth.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Since the mass (of misinformation) is massive, the friction is high, therefore a constant push is 
                            imperative.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            However, one crucial point must be added: unlike the purple drink, weed history, evolution, process, and 
                            usefulness are absolutely incomparable.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            There is not one nature’s product that has been more lied about and discredited in the history of 
                            humanity; but something is finally changing, the old script needs to be tossed away and rewritten.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            We identified and will clarify, six key bullet points that a true Cannabis connoisseur has to know:
                        </h5>
                        <h4>
                            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">

                        </h4>
                        <h5>
                            DISCLAIMER: unlike any other substance, THC and CBD will interact with the endocannabinoid system; 
                            everybody may have similar effects but not exactly the same (i.e: a more robust “couch lock” effect)
                        </h5>
                        <h4>
                            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">

                        <h5>
                            Who is better to assess the value of wine: 
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            A sidewalk alcoholic or a sommelier? 
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            And which one would you choose when entering a coffee shop:
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            A Bob Marley wannabe (pun intended) or an agriculture student, a connoisseur?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Jokes aside …
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            How do you evaluate cannabis?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            People judge cannabis in a variety of ways; some prefer the effects, some like the scent, and still 
                            others like the flavor. When a jar is open, it's always about the first perception of what it 
                            smells like.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            What flavors come to mind for you?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            What thoughts do you have?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Does it have a diesel odor?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Is it really lemony?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Is it the fragrance of pine needles?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            There are some aspects that will fire my curiosity about the flower, making me want to learn more about 
                            it, perhaps taste it, and then feel the impact.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Feel.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            It's highly important with the scent because it'll be your initial clue of how well the plant will 
                            function for you due to the senses or aromas that you detect when crushing that nug.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            If it reacts to us in a certain manner, we know it's the finest choice for us, since those precise 
                            scented terpenes will provide us with those types of impacts, which our bodies require. If it 
                            interacts with us when we are smelling and tasting it, we know it is beneficial for the body.
                        </h5>
                        <h4>

                        <h5>
                            So, what does that mean exactly developing the connoisseur's palette?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            It's all about having some recognition for what you’re consuming and that begins with the aroma. 
                            The first thing we do is stick our nose in the jar, that's one of the significant first steps for 
                            developing your palate is taking that in, assessing what you are smelling, and trying to relate some 
                            of their flavor or aroma. Once you begin to identify certain aromas in your life, the sours, the fruits, 
                            the different types, over time as your palette develops you will begin to understand how those aromas 
                            ultimately translate into the flavor and how it ultimately translate into the effects that you feel in 
                            your cannabis. So before sparking the light, you will take what is known as a “dry hit”.

                        <h5>
                            It's your first time tasting <b class="bold_text">this</b> cannabis,
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Does it taste the same as what you smelled? Or a bit different? now what you want to be doing is to 
                            inhale while paying attention to those flavors that I'm experiencing on the inhale and I'm going to 
                            compare them to what I experience in the flavors that I get when I exhale, a little bit through the 
                            mouth and a little bit through the nose.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            You can really get a good idea of what's going on in that cannabis.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Truly exceptional cannabis won't be singularly sweet, singularly sour, or singularly this or that, 
                            it's gonna have layers and it's gonna have this multi-dimensionality to it.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            It's going to have high notes and they just have some subtlety that begins to express itself only 
                            after you've been smoking this joint for a while, and get some Woody notes, perhaps some Cedar notes.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            On the exhale pay attention to the aftertaste, 
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            The more cannabis you smoke the more you will be able to recognize each of these individual flavors, if 
                            it is some exceptional cannabis the room is not just going to smell smoky, instead, you're going to 
                            actually smell the pine flavor that you smell in the air.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Do you have to tickle your nose? How is the mouthfeel? it's kind of a dry mouth? feel silky and smooth? 
                            what's the lungs feel like? Does it just sits nicely in there, comforting, or does that expand your 
                            lungs? When take in that hit it just wants to burst back out?
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            All these things play a role in developing your connoisseur's palette, and it just goes all the way 
                            through with paying attention to each of these steps along the way.
